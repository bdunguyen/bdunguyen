### Hi there!
I'm Britney, I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and **computer graphics** an incoming software development engineering intern @Amazon.

Previously, I served as President of the Women in Computer Science Club at UC Davis to cultivate a community to empower women and gender minorities in tech. I am currently a Computer Science Instructor II for Juni Learning to guide brilliant kids into programming. Additionally I'm a Student Researcher at UC Davis Health where I'm programming a device to detect breast cancer tissue.

some of my proficient+ skills:
* c/c#/c++
* python
* vb.net
* django
* tensorflow/keras

I am interested in developing my skills in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and keeping up with recent scientific developments. Outside of school and work, I enjoy creating art, reading, and going to the gym.

**Let's connect!**
