💡 Software Engineer | Researcher | Student

🎓 Studying Computational Statistics @ UC Davis

# 👋 Hi there! I'm Britney.

I'm primarily interested in **AI/ML, Cloud Computing, and full-stack development** and this past summer I worked as a software development engineering intern @Amazon.

Previously, I served as President of the Women in Computer Science Club at UC Davis to cultivate a community to empower women and gender minorities in tech. I also worked as a Computer Science Instructor II for Juni Learning to guide brilliant kids into programming. Additionally, I worked as a Student Researcher at UC Davis Health where I'm programming a device to detect breast cancer tissue.

I am interested in developing my skills in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and keeping up with recent scientific developments. Outside of school and work, I enjoy creating art, reading, and going to the gym.
